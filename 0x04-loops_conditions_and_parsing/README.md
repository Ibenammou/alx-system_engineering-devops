# Project Title: 0x04. Loops, conditions, and parsing

## Description
This project focuses on mastering Bash scripting for DevOps, covering SSH key creation, loop usage, conditional statements, and proper scripting practices.

## Learning Objectives
- Create SSH key pairs
- Use loops, conditions, and parsing effectively
- Ensure script portability and pass Shellcheck validations

## Tasks
1. **Create SSH RSA key pair**
   - Generate RSA key pair
   - Share public key (`0-RSA_public_key.pub`)
   - Fill SSH public key field in intranet profile
   - Keep private key secure

2. **For Best School loop**
   - Write Bash script using `for` loop to display "Best School" 10 times.

3. **While Best School loop**
   - Write Bash script using `while` loop to display "Best School" 10 times.

4. **Until Best School loop**
   - Write Bash script using `until` loop to display "Best School" 10 times.

5. **If 9, say Hi!**
   - Write Bash script to display "Best School" 10 times, with "Hi" on 9th iteration using `while` loop and `if` statement.

6. **4 bad luck, 8 is your chance**
   - Write Bash script to loop from 1 to 10, displaying messages based on iteration using `while` and `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.

7. **Superstitious numbers**
   - Write Bash script to display numbers from 1 to 20, with special messages for 4th, 9th, and 17th iterations using `while` loop and `case` statement.

8. **Clock**
   - Write Bash script to display time for 12 hours and 59 minutes using `while` loop.

9. **For ls**
   - Write Bash script to display content of current directory in list format, showing part of name after first dash using `for` loop.

10. **To file, or not to file**
    - Write Bash script to check and provide information about school file using `if` and `else`.

11. **FizzBuzz**
    - Write Bash script to display numbers from 1 to 100, with messages for multiples of 3, 5, or both using `for` loop.
